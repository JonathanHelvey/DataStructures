<h1 align="center">DataStructures</h1>

Different algorithms and data structures from various sources arcoss the inter webs.

Prepare for coding bootcamps or job interviews with this all in one source!

## Get Started

```
1. Fork Repo
2. Clone Repo to your Computer
3. NPM install (installs JEST)
4. A - The `A` at the beginning of JS file means your ANSWER goes there. Answers are in the same file below the `A` file.
5. Commit Changes to your GitHub.
        git add .
        git commit -m 'your message'
        git push origin master
6. TRY NOT TO LOOK AT ANSWERS!!!


***Recomendations

-Give yourself 30 minutes to answer each question. If you are still stuck after the 30 minute mark take a peek at the answer and try to solve it one more time.

-Keep a journal of your progress.

```

### TESTING (TDD)

```
-Test with Jest(https://jestjs.io/)
*Click on link for Jest Documentation.
More Commands can be found on the Jest website.
```

#### `RUN TESTS`

```
npm test --runs all test once.

npm run testWatch --runs/watches changes on all tests.

npm run test -t 'TestName' --runs a single test

```

\*\*\* `Debugger` You can run debugger in VS Code using VS Codes debugger tool. Launch.json file is included to debug in vscode with jest.
